# magic-squares

A learning project in Rust -- generate and test magic (or semi-magic) squares.

### goals

* Find squares of arbitrary size
* Handle some special conditions
    * Things like optionally checking the diagonals
    * Filter the inputs -- test for magic squares of composed only of cubes and things like that
* Learn more about Rust
    * Make it actually do multithreaded stuff. Fancy that.
